## Self-Reflection:
<!-- Write your self-reflection under this line -->
I feel that I need to gatherr a better understanding of the concepts covered in last week and this weeks assignments as I still do not feel that familiar with DOM and JSON.

Storage lab:
  This lab took me a little longer than it should have due to not calling preventdefault correctly.
### How long it took me to finish this?
This took me about 2-3 hours to complete as I got a bit confused by the instructions and did not realize we just needed to follow along with the code presented.

Storage Lab:
  This lab took me about 2.5 hours
